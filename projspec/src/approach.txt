#Project approach
To be able to handle and track the vast amount of features and requirements also over geographically 
split locations the track management system JIRA has been chosen. 

Extended with plugins for agile project management this will help the design teams and management 
to keep track of the different faces of the project. These tools will also make it possible for the 
project to make more accurate time estimations.

The Agile tools in JIRA are based on SCRUM and it is therefore convenient for the project to use an adaptation of the same.

## Features and Requirements
Feature wise it is easy to say that WA7 shall support the same features and functionality as the previous version. 
But the problem is to be able to keep track on what we currently have and priorities them. 

There is a need to rapidly being able to gather all those features and requirements in a 
trackable system adding screen shots of how the features currently are implemented.

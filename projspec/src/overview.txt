# Project Overview

## Background
During the inspection to conduct a refactor of the existing WebAccess front-end it was found not to be flexible enough to support future needs even if a refactoring of the code base was done.
The ExtJS java script framework was evaluated and found suitable for the task at hand. Integration work toward the current PHP backend was done and a thin zarafa specific framework was developed on top of the ExtJS in order to prove that the technical solution would work.

## Business value
The 'new WebAccess' will allow Zarafa's customers and partners to make custom extensions and custom integrations. The plugin/context model used will facilitate Zarafa to be able to combine special features of the WebAccess as offerings to the customer.

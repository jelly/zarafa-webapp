/**
 * @class Zarafa.calendar.ui.canvas.CalendarDaysView
 * @extends Zarafa.calendar.ui.AbstractCalendarDaysView
 *
 * Canvas based implementation of {@link Zarafa.calendar.ui.AbstractCalendarDaysView AbstractCalendarDaysView}.
 * This implementation creates canvas DOM elements for the parent view's header and body. These canvas elements
 * are then used by child appointment views to render to. The Calendar body consist of all normal appointments,
 * while the header will display the allday appointments.
 *
 * The canvas rendering is build in 3 layers. This means that for drawing the header, 3 canvas elements will
 * be used, the same as with the body. In total this means 6 canvas elements are rendered for the calendar.
 *
 * Using layering we can optimize the rendering of the calendar. Whenever an appoint changes, we are not
 * interested in redrawing the complete calendar and all appointments in it (This would become a performance
 * issue for calendars with many appointments). So with 3 layers we can create the following setup:
 *
 *  - Layer 1 : The calendar
 *    This contains the calendar background. For the header this means the background color, and the
 *    name of the date which is being displayed in the color (optionally additional markup is applied
 *    in case the rendered date is 'today'). For the body this means that all timestrips are rendered
 *    into the calendar (using the correct theme color).
 *  - Layer 2 : The appointments
 *    This contains all the appointments which are available in the calendar. None of the appointments
 *    are allowed to overlap with another appointment (The time can obviously overlap, but in that case
 *    the appointments are placed side-by-side inside the same column). Whenever a single appointment
 *    changes, we only have to redraw that single appointment (since it doesn't overlap with any other
 *    appointment, we can be sure that redrawing the appointment will not affect other appointments).
 *  - Layer 3 : The selections
 *    The most volatile layer which displays appointment outlines (black borders) and dragHandles
 *    (small boxes on the edges), which are positioned exactly on top of an appointment on Layer 2.
 *    Whenever the selection changes, we only require that Layer 3 is cleared an redrawn (or when a
 *    appointment is selected, but no other appointment is deselected, then only the outline will have
 *    to be drawn.
